<h3 id="-1-janice-the-admin">#1 Janice the admin</h3>
<p>Janice is non-technical, but must interact with this system a great deal at the beginning of the semester, and then make adjustments as the semester progresses.  Janice wants to produce an optimal work study schedule with as little user input as possible.  She can invite new users to the system, require them to fill out availability, and then easily generate a schedule when she&#39;s satisfied.  She also wants an intuitive interface for changing schedules later on.  It&#39;s very important that she not have to fight with the system to get her job done.  Janice is busy, and scheduling is not her main priority.</p>
<h3 id="-2-phil-the-work-study-student">#2 Phil the work-study student</h3>
<p>Phil is non-technical, and doesn&#39;t interact with this system very much.  Janice sent him an email with a link once at the beginning of the semester, and he followed it to log into a strange scheduling portal he vaguely remembers seeing last semester.  It&#39;s been a long time, and Phil can&#39;t remember his password.  Phil is busy and doesn&#39;t have time to sit and remember where all of the features are.  He wants a simple interface to give janice his work availability so he can get back to his homework.  If it takes longer than drafting an email to Janice, Phil might get frustrated.</p>
<h3 id="-3-chenda-the-potential-new-hire">#3 Chenda the potential new hire</h3>
<p>Chenda is non-technical, but pretty good with web interfaces like facebook and google calendar.  She&#39;s applying for a job at the Writing Center, and Janice sent her an email to fill out some personal info.  When she gets some free time, she clicks the link and logs into a scheduling portal.  She&#39;s unsure exactly what Janice wanted, so she begins filling out any forms and fields the portal gives her.  She&#39;s excited about the prospects of a new job, and spends time clicking around to see what&#39;s behind all the buttons and navigation links.  After spending a while exploring, she submits her schedule and sends Janice an email saying the task is complete - just to make sure.</p>
